&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissonance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author reflects on their experience as a touring musician who enjoyed making music but disliked attending concerts, leading to a sense of dissonance between their profession and personal interests. They share similar anecdotes about individuals whose professional activities do not align with their personal consumption or preferences, such as a vegetarian cattle farmer and a heart surgeon who has never needed heart surgery. The author concludes that this dissonance is a natural part of life and does not necessarily indicate that one is in the wrong line of work, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and accepting these contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;
