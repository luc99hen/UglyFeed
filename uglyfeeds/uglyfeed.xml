&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissonance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article explores the dissonance between one's profession and personal interests, using the author's experience as a touring musician who disliked attending concerts as a starting point. The author highlights several examples of individuals whose professional activities do not align with their personal preferences, such as a vegetarian cattle farmer and a heart surgeon who has never needed heart surgery. The piece concludes with a reflection on the natural and acceptable nature of this dissonance, suggesting that it is a common and normal aspect of life, much like how we produce and consume salt water but do not drink it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Outline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;: Several examples are provided to illustrate the theme, including a vegetarian cattle farmer, a masseuse who dislikes massages, and a heart surgeon who has never needed heart surgery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: The author reflects on the naturalness of this dissonance, drawing a metaphor from the production and consumption of salt water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
